<h4>Here's a new bit of fun that I thought up.</h4></center>

<b>Previous News...</b> <a href="efoct97.html">Oct 1997,</a>

<P>

I will try to keep this page up to date month by month. It will show any appearances or vocalisations by <b>Ellen</b> which are currently happening. If a film or television show is playing or about to play in a town or on a network near you, if it's music on the radio or your favourite tape in your car; We want to know about it. OK, enough of that, let's start with some actual examples.

<h2>OCTOBER 1997</h2>

<h2>Television</h2>

<i>October 4, 7, 8, 13, 24, 28.</i><P>
<A HREF="efhair.html"><b>HAIR</b></A> the movie. Visit the Ellen Foley Film and TV section for details of the film, but believe me it's a very good appearance and not a "King Of Comedy, Two Seconds And The Rest Ended Up On The Cutting Room Floor."<P>
<b>HAIR</b> is showing on Australia's Optus Vision Pay TV Network, Channel 19 Movie Greats, on October 4, 7, 8, 13, 24, 28. The classification is <b>M</b> for mature audiences, adult themes and drug usage. This is the final playing for Optus Vision. If you cannot receive the Optus Vision Pay TV Network, you can try to hire the video, or buy it from a store near you (or if all else fails, buy it from the U.S.A.)
