<center><h1>Foley Matthews Feedback.</h1><p></center>

Thank you for reaching this point. Let me emphasise again that I am indeed keen to receive any and all feedback via email, but I have to make it 
difficult for the email bots to find me.<p>

Humans please read the following carefully. (Auto-emailers need NOT apply!)<p>
It is strange but true, there are no e's at all in my true email address. So you will need to edit out each and every one after you click the following link.<p>
Kindly email me at <a href="mailto:tiebs00e01@hoetemaiel.ceom">tiebs00e01@hoetemaiel.ceom</a><p>

Please use the "back" button on your browser to get out of here.
