I will try to keep this page up to date month by month. It will show any appearances or vocalisations by <b>Ellen</b> which are currently happening. If a film or television show is playing or about to play in a town or on a network near you, if it's music on the radio or your favourite tape in your car; We want to know about it. OK, enough of that, let's start with some actual examples.
