<h4>Here's a new bit of fun that I thought up.</h4></center>

<P>

I will try to keep this page up to date month by month. It will show any appearances or vocalisations by <b>Ellen</b> which are currently happening. If a film or television show is playing or about to play in a town or on a network near you, if it's music on the radio or your favourite tape in your car; We want to know about it. OK, enough of that, let's start with some actual examples.
<p>

<h2>FEBRUARY 1998</h2>
</center>
<h2>Television</h2>

<I>February 2, 10, 18, 27 & 28.</I><P>
<A HREF="efctl.html"><b>Cocktail.</b></A> Visit the Ellen Foley Film and TV section for details of the film, but believe me it's a very good appearance and not a "King Of Comedy, Two Seconds And The Rest Ended Up On The Cutting Room Floor."<P>
<B>See Ellen make fun of Tom Cruise.</B><P>

<b>Cocktail</b> is showing on Australia's Optus Vision Pay TV Network, Channel 18 Movie Extra, on February 2, 10, 18, 27 & 28. The classification is <b>M</b> for mature audiences. If you cannot receive the Optus Vision Pay TV Network, you can try to hire the video, or buy it from a store near you (or if all else fails, buy it from the U.S.A.) 
<P>

<I> February 3.</I><P>
And a bonus appearance on Free To Air TV this month. (It's Foley heaven!!)<BR>
<A HREF="eftoot.html"><b>Tootsie.</b></A> Visit the Ellen Foley Film and TV section for details of the film, but believe me it's a very good appearance and not a "King Of Comedy, Two Seconds And The Rest Ended Up On The Cutting Room Floor."  Please note that Ellen lost her voice halfway through the filming of this one, which goes to explain why she is not featured quite as highly as was originally intended.<P>
<b>Tootsie</b> is showing on Australia's, Nine Network Free To Air TV Network, on February 3. The classification is <b>PG</b>, parental guidance recommended. If you cannot receive the Australian, Nine Network Free To Air TV Network, you can try to hire the video, or buy it from a store near you (or if all else fails, buy it from the U.S.A.) I applaud the Nine Network Free To Air TV Network for making this film available at this time.
