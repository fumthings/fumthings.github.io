"King of Comedy", 1982, 105 minutes, colour. <p>

Robert Pupkin (Robert De Niro) is a "would be" comedian and obsessed fan of Jerry Langford (Jerry Lewis), a hugely successful
 comedian. Pupkin meets Langford when he helps remove obsessed fan, Marsha, (Sandra Bernhard) from Langford's Limousine. 
Later Pupkin helps Marsha kidnap Langford so that Marsha can have "dinner" with Langford and so that Pupkin can feature on 
Langford's comedy show. Pupkin is a hit and becomes the new "King of Comedy". <p>

What's this got to do with <b>Ellen Foley</b>, you ask?<p>

Well, before the kidnap is planned, Pupkin and Marsha are having an animated argument in the street and a crowd is staring 
and egging them on. Marsha calls these people "Street Scum" and according to the final credits of the film, the "Street Scum"
 include, <b>Ellen Foley</b>, Mick Jones, Joe Strummer, Paul Simonon, Kosmo Vynil, Jerry Baxter-Worman, Don Letts ("The Clash
" and friends from their album "Sandanista!") and Pearl Harbour (who was Paul Simonon's girlfriend and is also a singer) and 
Gaby Salter (Gaby Salter was indeed somebody - Joe Strummer's then girlfriend and eventual wife! On the album "Sandinista!" he 
mentions his "sweet Gabriella" in the song "Junco Partner." So there you go, the street scum were a complete Clash package.)
<p>

It's about 32 mins and 10 secs into the film, and at the very end of the 2 min 19 sec street scene.<p>

This is probably a good point at which to remind you of one of the helpful <a href="saying3.html"><b>sayings</b></a> we have
