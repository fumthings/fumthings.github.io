<center><h1>Foley Matthews Information, Change of name by Deed Poll...</h1>

<h4>Here are the answers to some questions, please don't ask me anything else.</h4></center>

<p>

People ask me why I changed my name. Apart from the obvious, I tell them the real question is "why did I change my whole name"; and that the answers to this are that I felt it was easier, smoother, sounded better, sounded complete and the new names had meaning (to me), and would prompt other people better if they started calling me by a different first name instead of giving me more grief about not finding the (old) last name (i.e. they forgot), in systems in our workplace.

Changing one's name legally in the State of Queensland in the country of Australia.</h4></center>

<p>

Don't ask me about any other State, Country, or legal Jurisdiction; I have no idea.

<p>

You no longer have to go through all the stuff that I went through as the law has since been changed. For persons born in Queensland, Australia, I believe that you now simply register the change of name directly with the State Government agency known as Registry of Births, Deaths and Marriages, phone 07 3247 9203 for enquiries; and you can get an amended birth certificate there also. By amended, they mean that the new legal name is shown in notes at the bottom.

<p>

now to the grief...my recollections only...correct me if necessary...

<p>

Back then, one had to go through the Deed Poll process, which involved using a private solicitor or (as I learned much later) the Public Trustee solicitor. At the time, the State Government was talking about changing the law to simplify the procedure, as it turns out, talking about it for quite some time. To add insult to this, I also learned later that the law had finally been changed BUT, written in such a way that it did not come into effect until a date to be subsequently proclaimed. The State Government also took a long, long time to get around to proclaiming the required date, so that finally the simplification of the law came into effect. In any case this did nothing for me as I was following the private solicitor path.

<p>

I made an appointment and visited the solicitor, and he drew up the paperwork. His handwriting, or his typists questionable reading/comprehension, caused my name to be fluffed yet again, and so the paperwork was corrected and reprinted, signed and witnessed. The fee was a few hundred dollars. The Deed Poll then needed to by "filed" with the appropriate authority, The Supreme Court of Queensland. The solicitor then told me that he did not know "what the filing time would be". (But presumably it would go through in due course.)

<p>

Months and months and months went by. Technically my name was changed the moment I signed as such, but could not tell anyone or prove anything until I got something official back. I didn't see the point of asking the solicitor at first because they probably charge for taking phone enquiries. I did however try to get some phone advice from the Law Society about why he would take so long, or the Deed Poll process itself (this side tracked about the legislative changes without resolving anything) and I found that I could enquire general information at the Supreme Court as well. I think I found that it had not been "filed" at this stage.
<br>
Finally, further fees or not I HAD to phone the solicitor. Pretty much all he said was that they had ONLY VERY RECENTLY handed it over to an agency to do the "filing". so I guess I wait just a little bit longer.

<p>

Finally more phone enquiries with the Supreme Court, or was it when I visited there to get legal copies of the official paper? (which, damned if I was going to ask the solicitor about). 

<p>

HERE IS THE PROBLEM!!!

<p>

When a solicitor tells me that he doesn't know what the filing time with the Supreme Court might be, it seems to me that an appointment was to be made to go before a Judge/Magistrate to "check that it was OK" to "allow" this change of name. The TRUTH is nothing of the kind. "Filing" means queuing (maybe) at a clerks counter and paying the fee; something I could have easily driven 40km on my day off to do in a timely fashion, myself, instead of leaving it with a solicitor who just couldn't be bothered sending someone, at some time, amidst other legal work in the State Capital, to PUT DOCUMENTS OVER A COUNTER!!!

<p>

Needless to say that I shall not be using your firm for any civil matters again!!!

<p>

The guy is NOT a shonk, but he sure jerked me around when I needed help with this.

<P>

If the law had not been changed and the Deed Poll process was still necessary, I would suggest the following. The Public Trustee solicitors could hardly be worse than this. Whichever you chose to use, take the paperwork from them as soon as possible and go to the city yourself and find out how to put documents over a counter (it's not that complicated). The court clerks also said it could be filed by mailing it in (if you live outside the capital city presumably).

<p>

This does not constitute legal advice, you are responsible for your own actions or omissions
