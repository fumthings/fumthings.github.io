 have no trouble spotting her in the <b>red dress.</b> Also at the party are Hildy's husband Jimmy (Stuart Pankin) and their 
friends, Dan Gallager (Michael Douglas) and his wife Beth (Anne Archer). It is at <i>this</i> party that Dan and Alex (Glenn 
Close) first meet. Duration 3 min 35 secs.<P>

After a gap of approx. 40 mins 50 secs during which Dan and Alex have a weekend fling, Dan ends the affair but Alex will NOT 
be scorned; second scene featuring Hildy <B>(Ellen)</B>, with Jimmy, Dan and Beth relaxing at the bowling alley. Duration 1

After a gap of approx 3 mins 30 secs, third scene with Jimmy and Hildy having dinner with Dan and Beth at their home. This 
dinner with friends is a happy time which serves to counterpoint the terror that is to come when Alex's obsessive acts take 
a major turn for the worse. This would be <b>Ellen's</b> biggest scene in the film. Duration 4 mins 33 secs.<br>

Later, "mad woman" Alex continues her terrifying obsession, cooking the Gallager's pet rabbit and taking Dan and Beth's child
 on a roller coaster ride behind their backs. Beth crashes the car due to worry. Dan half throttles Alex. Alex invades their 
home and absent-mindedly nicks bits off her leg as she waves a large knife around. Dan only half drowns Alex and so Beth 
finally shoots her dead. A happy ending at last.<p>
