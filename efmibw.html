The black, police commissioner of New York is found dead in a pond in Central Park. Every available officer is called in to work on the case including Lieutenant Frank Janek (Richard Crenna) of internal affairs. The circumstances are very suspicious. Bump on the back of the head. Shoes and socks off and trouser legs rolled up. Wallet missing but still had his gun. Did he drown? Was he drunk? Was it a meeting that went wrong. Was he mugged. Was it a racial attack, or was it something else. And what can the police public relations department tell the press now that won’t make things look even worse.<P>
