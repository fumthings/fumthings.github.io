Thank you for reaching this point. Let me emphasise again that I am indeed keen to receive any and all feedback 
via email, but I have to make it difficult for the email-bots to find me.<p>

Humans please read the following carefully. (Auto-emailers need NOT apply!)<p>
It is strange but true, there are no e's at all in my true email address. So you will need to edit out each and every one after you click the following link.<p>
Kindly email me at <a href="mailto:tiebs00e01@hoetemaiel.ceom">tiebs00e01@hoetemaiel.ceom</a><p>
