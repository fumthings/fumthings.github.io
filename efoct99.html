I will try to keep this page up to date month by month. It will show any appearances or vocalisations by <b>Ellen</b> which are currently happening. If a film or television show is playing or about to play in a town or on a network near you, if it's music on the radio or your favourite tape in your car; We want to know about it. OK, enough of that, let's start with some actual examples.

Official synopsis... <BR>
"In RANDOM HEARTS, an act of fate throws two very different people together: Dutch Van Den Broeck (Harrison Ford), a tough-minded
internal affairs cop involved in a high-stakes corruption case, and Kay
Chandler (Kristin Scott Thomas), a high-profile congresswoman
embroiled in a bitter re-election campaign. They develop an
extraordinary relationship which forces them to confront the truth that
threatens to destroy them and discover the strength to triumph over
the deception that surrounds them."

Borrowed from the Internet Movie DataBase...<BR>
"Although they were perfectly content with their lives, Edward
Davis (Harrison Ford) and Vivien Simpson (Kristin Scott Thomas)
discover that things are not always what they seem when their
respective spouses die mysteriously in a plane crash. A police
detective sheds light on the situation when he reveals that they
were travelling together under false names and each had in their
possession an identical key to an unknown rendezvous. Overcome by
anger and confusion at the affair, Edward and Vivien are
determined to figure out the truth about their adulterous spouses
and their own lives.
