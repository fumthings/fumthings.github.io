Sixth and final scene containing <b>Ellen</b>. Duration 1 min. Flanagan returns to his uncle Pat's bar, Flanagan and Miss 
Mooney to marry. Eleanor seen with some old geezer "Eddie". <p>

The film has a good sound track.<p>

Comment:- <b>Ellen</b>'s part in this film seems to turn full circle the old cliche of "Actress goes to New York and takes 
job as a waitress to make ends meet" even to the extent that the name of her waitress character is Eleanor. <p>

You may have noticed that <b>Ellen</b> has a fairly minor, but no less important role in this film. Well, we have a
