<h4>Here's a new bit of fun that I thought up.</h4></center>

<b>Previous News...</b> <a href="efoct97.html">Oct 1997,</a> <a

<P>

I will try to keep this page up to date month by month. It will show any appearances or vocalisations by <b>Ellen</b> which are currently happening. If a film or television show is playing or about to play in a town or on a network near you, if it's music on the radio or your favourite tape in your car; We want to know about it. OK, enough of that, let's start with some actual examples.

<h2>JANUARY 1998</h2>
</center>
<h2>Television</h2>

<I>January 18.</I><P>
<A HREF="efmtm.html"><b>Married To The Mob.</b></A> Visit the Ellen Foley Film and TV section for details of the film, but believe me it's a very good appearance and not a "King Of Comedy, Two Seconds And The Rest Ended Up On The Cutting Room Floor."<P>
<b>Married To The Mob</b> is showing on Australia's Network TEN free to air TV Network, on January 18 at 8:30pm. The classification is <b>M</b> for mature audiences (I think). (Oh yeah, now I remember, rated M for violence and language. Mobsters bumping people off, you know the type of thing. (and they say TV violence desensitises people)). Hey! I've also noticed that you get to see <B>Ellen</B> in the long promo for this film, they must have showed this a couple of dozen times. Wow, half a second. It's Foley heaven. But if you cannot receive Australia's Network TEN free to air TV Network , you can try to hire the video, or buy it from a store near you (or if all else fails, buy it from the U.S.A.).  I  applaud Australia's Network TEN free to air TV Network for making this film available at this time.
