<center><h1>"Married to the Mob",<br>Starring Ellen Foley, Michelle Pfeiffer, Dean Stockwell, Mathew Modine, Mercedes Ruehl 
and Alec Baldwin.</h1>
I can say that with a degree of honesty as this is the only major motion picture I know of where <b>Ellen's</b> name appears
 in the opening titles, they just don't appear in this order.
